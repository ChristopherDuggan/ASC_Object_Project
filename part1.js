/* In Part 1, we're going to create a Superhero list! Think back to previous
 * lessons, help your classmates if things are going smoothly, and ask for help
 * if you need it!
 */


// 1. create three superheroes with the same format as Nobody Man

const nobodyMan = {
  name: "Nobody Man",
  secretIdentity: "Bob Fakeman",
  powers: ['invisibility', 'can erase your memory of him'],
  team: 'The Randos',
  saying: "You don't know me!",
}

// Add your heroes here




// 2. Create an array called "heroes" and put your hero objects in it




/* 3. Create a loop that makes a <div> element for each hero in the array. The
 * div should contain the following:
 *    a. An <h2> element that contains the hero's name at the top
 *    b. <p> elements that contain the hero's team and secret identity with
 *    labels
 *    c. An <ul> element that contains an <h3> element that contains "Powers:"
 *    and an <li> element that contains each of hero's powers
 *    d. A <p> element that has the hero's saying in quotes
 *
 *  The final product should look like this:
 *
 *  <div>
 *    <h2>Nobody Man</h2>
 *    <p>Team: The Randos</p>
 *    <p>Secret Identity: Bob Fakeman</p>
 *    <ul>
 *      <h3>Powers:</h3>
 *      <li>invisibility</li>
 *      <li>can erase your memory of him</li>
 *    </ul>
 *    <p>"You don't know me!"</p>
 *  </div>
 *
 * Finally, the loop should append the created div to the #hero-list element in
 * the index.html.
