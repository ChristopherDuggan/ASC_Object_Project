/* In Part 2 we will create a form that will allow the user to create a new
 * superhero to add to our list. You can do this!
 */

// 1. Create a form that has an input for the hero's name, secret identity,
// powers, team, and their saying. Give the form a button that says "Add Hero" and append it to the #form-box div



// 2. Add an event listener to the form's button that checks for a click, then
// calls a function called "addHero."



/* 3. Modify the addHero function so that it creates an object using the values
 * in the form, then adds it to the hero array created in part1. Here is a reminder of
 * what our hero objects from part 1 looked like:
 *
 * {
 * name: "Nobody Man",
 * secretIdentity: "Bob Fakeman",
 * powers: ['invisibility', 'can erase your memory of him'],
 * team: 'The Randos',
 * saying: "You don't know me!",
 * }
 *
 * After the addHero function adds our new hero to the array, rewrite the
 * contents of the #hero-list div so that it includes the hero that's been just
 * added
 */

function addHero() {

}

// Part 2 complete!

/* Bonus Ideas:
 * Add images for your heroes
 * style up the page so it looks puuuuurty
